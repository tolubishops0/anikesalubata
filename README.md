# ANIKESTORE

## Project Description
This project is a React-based frontend for showcasing handmade shoes as part of my side business. It serves as a demonstration of my skills with React, particularly with context management, local storage data handling, and integrating Firebase for authentication. The site allows users to browse products by category, search (with autocomplete feature), and manage items in their cart.

### Features
- Browse products by categories such as loafers, corporate shoes, slides, boots, and Birkenstocks.
- Search for products with an autocomplete feature.
- Like products and view a list of liked items.
- Detailed product views with options to like and add to cart.
- Size and quantity selection through a modal popup.
- Cart management: add, remove, adjust quantity, and clear cart.
- Authentication system with Firebase (Sign up, Sign in, Password reset).
- Checkout process including delivery details and simulated payment entry.
